# i2c_adapter
A simple USB to I2C adapter.

Status (Dec 2023): Work in progress. Initial version works.

Design goals:
* USB to I2C master.
* Supports Windows/Mac/Linux.
* Uses of-the-shelf inexpensive hardware.
* No driver installation required (emulates a serial port).
* Simple Python API.
* Can be easyly moded or adapted to new hardware.
